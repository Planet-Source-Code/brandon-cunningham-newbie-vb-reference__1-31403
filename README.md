### Description

NEWBIE MUST HAVE VB REFERENCE:<br>

I spent about a week compiling various commands and functions before I began my first project, not ALL the code is mine, but ALOT of it is. I have previous experience coding in some less popular languages, so I knew what I was looking for ;-) I personally created the three custom controls FontCombo, ColorCombo and LabeledText and some of the following are must haves:<br>

Directory Commands<br>

File Commands<br>

How to use Font and File Dialogs<br>

How to use and manipulate List<br>

How to Parse by delimiter<br>

And there is just a lot of things here, that you will either learn here, or you will HAVE TO learn somewhere else because you will need this stuff.

PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!!!
